🔷 Design and Technical Features

    Font Awesome icons for UI.

    Custom CSS (style.css) used for branding/styling.

    Dynamic components (like the course dropdown and carousel) depend on Bootstrap's JavaScript.

🔷 Notable Observations

    Some text is placeholder ("Lorem ipsum")—these should be updated with real content.

    Dropdown courses are repeated thrice—you might want to consolidate that.

    All links point to localhost, which means this is under local development. They should be updated when deploying online.

    Some grammar issues in testimonials could be refined for professionalism.
